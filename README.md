# Faulty-Calculator
This is an basic exercise of JAVASCRIPT .

A fun and quirky **Faulty Calculator** made using **HTML**, **JavaScript** that sometimes returns incorrect answers on purpose. This project is meant for beginners to understand basic DOM manipulation and logic implementation in JavaScript.

## Features

- Simple calculator UI
- Performs basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Injects randomness**: Has a small chance to give an intentionally incorrect result (because it's faulty ðŸ˜„)
- Clean HTML +  JavaScript, no external libraries

## How It Works

- The calculator takes two numbers and an operation as input.
- A random number is generated internally.
- If the random value is below a threshold (e.g., 10%), the calculator gives a **wrong** answer.
- Otherwise, it performs the correct operation.

## Learnings

- DOM Manipulation with JavaScript
- Event Handling
- Basic Math operations in JS
- Introducing randomness using `Math.random()`
